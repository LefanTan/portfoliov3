    "purposeAndGoal": "The idea of Popin is to build an event-finding platform for students on campus. Students would come on the app to find events, or to post on the built-in forum to engage with their community. \r\n\r\nThe ideal user flow would be:\r\n1. Students have the intent to attend an event. Perhaps they want to socialize, or they have a couple hours currently to spare.\r\n2. Students log on to the app; only students with a valid university email are allowed. \r\n3. Student find an event that interest them, and sign up. All details of the events are available on Popin, such as attending users count, location, ticket prices etc.\r\n4. 30 minutes prior to the event, student would receive a pop notification to remind them. ",
    "problems": "Popin was built entirely on NextJS for its SSR capabilities, we wanted OpenGraph/Twitter Share Previews when users send events links to their peers, which I believe will help our product to grow organically. We also used CapacitorJS to port Popin to Android and IOS.\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\nWe also used Firestore as *backend* as well as other integrated Firebase tools such as Storage, Authentication, Functions and Messaging.\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\nUsing NextJS was perhaps not the best choice for the frontend. Since CapacitorJS doesn't support SSR (well, a phone app can't host a node server), we had to work around that and export our app in SSG mode anyways. I believe that the Ionic (made by the same developers by CapacitorJS) + VueJS would have been a better choice to reduce frictions when developing cross-platform early on in the project.\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\nA trick I learned from my mentor to generate Share Previews on a page-per-page basis for SPAs is to route requests to Cloud Function (this can be done on S3, GCS or Firebase Hosting) to modify the HTML response to include the required `<meta>` tags in order make Share Preview work. \r\nRead more about this trick [here](https://chrlschn.medium.com/grug-brained-ssr-with-20-lines-of-code-593932cb2c09).\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\nFirestore is also an interesting choice, we all know document-based database are fast to prototype with, especially since no backend is needed. However, we found out that our data model is mostly structured such that we didn't really need the benefits of Firestore. Additionally, there are a lot of JOINS operation required to display some of the pages, and JOINS aren't exactly optimized on a document-based database like Firestore. If I was to do this again, I would have used a relational database instead.",
    "lessonsLearned": "I've always wanted to build something that would be used by a mass audience. What's a better way to learn engineering than to build something that thousands of users will use? When I was pitched to build Popin, my curiosity and the idea itself was enough to persuade myself to build it for free, in exchange for an equal partnership and equity.\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\nHowever, Popin did not take off, and my brother and I have abandoned the project, here's my take on **why** it didn't work out and I hope this can help future early tech founders to determine whether to start \r\n\\\r\n\\\r\nTo build a successful startup requires **more** than just the idea, like a lot more, it's the **EXECUTION** as well. Throughout the product lifecycle, it is crucial that there already is a plan on product distribution; a product will not automatically \"blow up\" just because it is a great product (except for extreme cases like ChatGPT). With such limited resources, it's important that everyone in your team (usually 2-3 folks consisting of only the founders) has complementary skills that can make this idea work.\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\nAnd so, ask yourself this question before jumping into an idea and spend **HOURS** of your time building it. \r\n1. How compatible are you with the co-founders? This goes without saying, but do you all have complementary skills? Are everybody in the right place and time to equally pull their weight and give it their all to push the product from zero to hero? What's everyone's goal with building this startup, is it wealth, fulfillment, or simple to have something on the resume? Have these conversations early on. \r\n\r\n2. Is the idea just \"X but for Y\"? Ex. \"Facebook for Dogs\" or \"Snapchat for Students\" etc. These are usually bad and lazy ideas. \r\n\r\n3. What's the business model? A startup requires a sound business model, some might argue that user growth is way more important than revenue early on and I'd say \"it depends\". In our case, Popin is a social app, so user growth has the highest priority, if you're building a SASS, both will be equally as important. Regardless, having a clear business model for your startup can only benefit you during pitches, ideation, and perhaps even acquisition.\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\nI hesitate to call Popin a startup, as startup usually means a business that has HIGH and consistent growth. We were neither a business, high growth nor consistent but I did learn a lot from this experience. ",

To build a reliable stream of passive income. \r\n\\\r\n\\\r\nUltimately, I'm proud to say that I succeeded when it comes to achieving the first two goals - Vento is my most successful side project to date and a big part is because of working with a great partner.\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\nWhile Vento didn't exactly took off to become a screen recording with massive cult following - We gained ~1600 users in 6 months (not great, but not terrible) with ~25 paying subscribers. Due to work reasons, I had to step down from working on Vento and sold its assets for a low five-figure sum. So achieving Goal 3 is off the tables. \r\n\\\r\n\\\r\nHowever, I've learned a lot building this tool. Most of I've ever learned aside from my day job.",

    "lessonsLearned": "### Technical \r\n1. Use commands to spin up any cloud services. This is useful if down the line you want to create similar instances in a different stage etc\r\n2. Related to above, create a dedicated service account for each service with minimal permissions\r\n3. Don't use technology that is TOO new. New changes come out so fast that you might spend more time than needed migrating between versions. Stick to stable technology 🤣 (looking at you, NextJS)\r\n4. Write decent docs 😅 \r\n \r\n\r\n\\\r\n### Business \r\n1. This one is life saver, but provide FANTASTIC customer support. Vento had lots of bugs, there are times when customers got really mad from bugs, until the point of almost churning. But this was saved by great customer support. \r\n  -   I don't believe Vento had churned customers due to bugs. We use Crisp as our CRM, ultimately, the point is to have an easy way for client to reach out.\r\n2. Customers aren't always right. You probably get requests from users to add X features. My Initial instinct would just be \"why not do them, make them happy\". But Chris would remind me to take a step back and weigh the risk and benefit of working on X feature. Risk can be X amount of eng hours that could be used on something else, allocation of resources was important for Vento (0 funding 🤣).\r\nChris likes to derisk by first building and releasing a really basic version of X feature, and use tracking or customer feedback to gauge engagement. I liked that a lot. \r\n3. Distribution is just as important as the product, it's a 50/50 relationship. Establishing a strategy to find the right marketing channel for Turas as soon as possible can determine whether Turas works. For Vento, we found SEM to be a promising channel with some luck on the influencer side, but because of my early step down, we never really validated if this is the case. Would love to have experienced with more marketing channels.",
